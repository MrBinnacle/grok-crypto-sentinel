# 📘 Grok Crypto Sentinel Template – README

This is the official Grok Crypto Sentinel Template. It enables high-signal, persona-calibrated crypto alerting using modular logic, narrative filters, and behaviorally aligned reflection triggers.

## 🚀 Overview

Grok Crypto Sentinel delivers structured, noise-resistant signal intelligence for crypto holders prioritizing asymmetric positioning and narrative risk filtering. It is designed for daily tactical use by distinct investor personas.

## 🔧 Usage Guide

1. Load `template.yaml` into your Grok Task.
2. Choose a persona from `persona_presets.yaml`.
3. Run the task at 9:15 AM ET.
4. Monitor output block for:
   - Entry opportunities
   - Macro/regulatory shifts
   - Whale movements
   - Contrarian sentiment alerts

Custom signals can be added under each block in the YAML.

### examples/sample_output_sniper.md
```markdown
[📆 2025-07-29 – 09:15 ET]

Quick Context: XRP holding in mid-volatility zone with low BTC correlation.

• 🔍 Volume Divergence
📉 XRP volume +46% in low-vol chop
🎯 Suggests potential early accumulation setup
🧭 Posture: [accumulate]

📈 Entry Radar Status: Near $2.85 zone
🧠 Daily Reflection: Conviction grows in silence.
```

### examples/sample_output_novice.md
```markdown
[📆 2025-07-29 – 09:15 ET]

Quick Context: No volatility or divergence across majors.

🟢 No critical signals today. Stay the course.

📈 Entry Radar Status: None triggered
🧠 Daily Reflection: Let others chase the obvious.
```

### docs/usage_walkthrough.md
```markdown
# Usage Guide

1. Load `template.yaml` into your Grok Task.
2. Choose a persona from `persona_presets.yaml`.
3. Run the task at 9:15 AM ET.
4. Monitor output block for:
   - Entry opportunities
   - Macro/regulatory shifts
   - Whale movements
   - Contrarian sentiment alerts

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Run test suite in `tests/` to ensure schema and persona compatibility.
- Output examples must match the markdown structure expected in Grok.
- Persona fusion logic must be synthetic-testable.

## 🧠 Anti-Vibe Codex Compliance

- Signal schema must enforce `what happened`, `why it matters`, and `suggested posture`.
- Repetition constraints: No identical signal type may re-trigger <24h.
- Output must never exceed 3 core insights per persona/day.

## 🔁 Future Versions

### [1.1.0] - TBD
- Expanded asset support (SOL, DOGE, AVAX)
- Signal priority tuning per strategy type
- Multi-channel webhook dispatcher
```
